# Python Password NEA
AQA GCSE 2018 Computer Science NEA by Nathan

## Installation

Pull the repo and you're done!

```bash
git pull https://github.com/nathangreen06/password-nea
```
If you are unfamiliar with git (it's ok!) then you should probably use a tool like GitHub Desktop ([download](https://desktop.github.com/))

## Usage

- I recommend that you use Microsoft's Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
- You can [download VSCode completely free here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
